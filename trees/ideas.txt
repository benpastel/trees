- check if de-biasing preds actually helps (at lower smoothness?)

- switch to binary trees, but allowing low <= v < hi splits... for that histogram efficiency gain?
  => circular, with NaN in between?

- keep exploring "parent mean" idea

- try modifying parent membership for the larger side of the split instead of writing new one
  e.g. if left_count is smaller, read right examples off the back until you see left_count of them, swap those out for the left_count holes, then truncate?
