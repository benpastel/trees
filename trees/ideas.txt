- check if de-biasing preds actually helps (at lower smoothness?)

- switch to binary trees, but allowing low <= v < hi splits... for that histogram efficiency gain?
  => circular, with NaN in between?

- switch to best-split-first

- keep exploring "parent mean" idea

- keep exploring including whether to build next tree in the best-split-first decision


EXPLORE / REFINE:
  1. for each tree, sample a subset for bucketing
  2. bucket both the subset & full set
  3. for each split:
    - for all features, build hist for subset
    - choose feature to split
    - for that feature, build hist for full node
    - choose split value based on full hist
